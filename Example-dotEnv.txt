The dotEnv file should be in the root of the server. It works 
exclusively for LOCAL development. Remember to add your dotEnv 
file to your .gitignore file (in the root as well). That is important 
for the privacy of your variables. The file should be called:

.env

If you are deploying to Heroku, you can set your environment variables
via your command prompt:

heroku config:set GITHUB_USERNAME=joesmith

You can consult your environment variables with:

heroku config

Your .env file should follow the next example format:

PORT=4004
DBURL=127.0.0.1
DBPORT=3306
DBUSER=root
DBPASSWORD=myPassword
DBNAME=peanutsdb
